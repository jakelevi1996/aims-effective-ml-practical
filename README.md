## AIMS Effective ML Practical
**Thursday 2nd May 2024**

This practical aims to cover:
1. **Cookiecutter Research**. Creating high-quality Python research repositories with minimal effort.

2. **Experiment configuration using Hydra**. Simplifying the configuration of complex ML experiments.

3. **Machine learning at scale using Ray** - Google have very kindly granted access to compute from their TPU Research Cloud (TRC) to use for the afternoon. Weâ€™ll use this to do some experiments with the same framework used to train ChatGPT.

The `0_shell` folder contains misc. quality-of-life suggestions for your machine set-up (shell, IDE etc.) to browse in your own time.


## Get started
Clone this repository with:
```
git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/joncarter1/effective-ml-practical.git
```
The `--recurse-submodules` option is important to ensure that external repository dependencies are also cloned into the `externals` folder.

I'd then recommend going through Parts 1 to 3 in order, which have their own README files with instructions within their respective folders.
